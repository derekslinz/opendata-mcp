"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/discovery/v1`` app bundle.

Phase 3 of the v2.0 presentation-plane plan. The discovery app is the
first MCP Apps *app* (as opposed to passive shape primitives): it issues
outbound ``tool_call`` messages back to the host. This file pins the
registration contract, the bundle's basic invariants, and the
"dependency-free" stance shared with the records primitive.

End-to-end host validation lives in the future Phase 6c Playwright smoke;
this file's tests run in-process and don't spin up a real iframe.
