"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/shape/geofeatures/v1`` primitive.

Phase 2b of the v2.0 presentation-plane plan. The geofeatures shape
primitive is a Leaflet-based map bundle that ~13 providers will bind
to in Phase 4 via ``_meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": <URI>}}``.

These tests pin the contract for the bundle so adopters in Phase 4 can
rely on:

- The resource is registered under the canonical, versioned URI.
- The bundle is non-empty, contains inline JS (``<script``), references
  Leaflet by name, and exposes a root ``<div id="...">`` mount point.
- ``resources/read`` returns the same bytes as the HTML file on disk
  (i.e. the loader and the handler don't drift).
- Bundle weight stays under 100KB — that's the Phase 6b budget the
  plan calls out, enforced here so we catch drift at unit-test time.
