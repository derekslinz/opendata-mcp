"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/entity-graph/v1`` app bundle.

Phase 5 of the v2.0 plan. The entity-graph app is the third MCP Apps
*app* (after discovery and vulnerability) and the first one that ships
a CDN-loaded visualisation library (D3.js v7). This file pins the
registration contract, the bundle's basic invariants, the no-innerHTML
security stance shared by every app surface, the <100KB bundle budget,
and the payload contract documented in the bundle's header comment.

End-to-end host validation lives in the Phase 6c Playwright smoke;
this file's tests run in-process and don't spin up a real iframe.
