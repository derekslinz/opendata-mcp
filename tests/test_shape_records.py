"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/shape/records/v1`` primitive.

Phase 2c of the v2.0 presentation-plane plan. The records shape primitive
is a dependency-free HTML table bundle that ~29 providers will bind to in
Phase 4 via ``_meta={"ui": {"resourceUri": <URI>}}``.

These tests pin the contract for the bundle so adopters in Phase 4 can
rely on:

- The resource is registered under the canonical, versioned URI.
- The bundle is non-empty, contains inline JS (``<script``), exposes a
  ``<table`` element for tabular rendering, and has a root ``<div id="...">``
  mount point.
- ``resources/read`` returns the same bytes as the HTML file on disk
  (i.e. the loader and the handler don't drift).
- Bundle weight stays under 100KB — that's the Phase 6b budget the plan
  calls out, enforced here so we catch drift at unit-test time.
- NO external ``<script src="http...">`` references — this primitive is
  dependency-free by design (the plan explicitly contrasts records with
  timeseries/geofeatures on this point).
