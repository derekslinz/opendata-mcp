"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/molecular/v1`` app bundle.

Phase 5 of the v2.0 plan. Molecular is the third MCP Apps *app*
(after discovery and vulnerability) and the second multi-provider
one. This file pins the registration contract, the bundle's basic
invariants, and the dependency-quality stance we apply to every
Phase 5 app: no inline charting libraries, no innerHTML, parent-only
postMessage, 100KB bundle budget.

The molecular app differs from vulnerability in one respect: it
relies on a single CDN (``3dmol.org``) for the 3Dmol.js viewer
library, which is ~700KB minified and would blow the bundle budget
if inlined. The ``test_bundle_has_only_3dmol_cdn_script`` test pins
that the CDN is exactly that origin — no other external scripts can
sneak in.

End-to-end host validation lives in the Phase 6c Playwright smoke;
this file's tests run in-process and don't spin up a real iframe.
