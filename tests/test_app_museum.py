"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/museum/v1`` app bundle.

Phase 5 of the v2.0 plan. The museum app wraps the Met Museum Open
Access ``met-search`` + ``met-get-object`` tools into one image-grid
panel with click-through provenance detail.

The bundle is a CC0-friendly art-discovery surface — the Met Open
Access program publishes every public-domain image under Creative
Commons Zero, which makes a "show me the Met's collection" panel
the natural Phase 5 image-driven app.

End-to-end host validation lives in the Phase 6c Playwright smoke
suite; this file's tests run in-process and don't spin up an iframe.
