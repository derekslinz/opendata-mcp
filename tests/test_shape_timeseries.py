"""Tests for the ``ui://meta-data-mcp/shape/timeseries/v1`` shape primitive.

This is the first of three v2.0 shape primitives (Phase 2a). The bundle is
a self-contained HTML+JS resource that renders ``{points, axes, annotations?}``
payloads as a line chart with a profile panel (min/max/mean/stddev/gap-count).

These tests cover the kernel-side contract:

- The resource is registered at the expected canonical URI.
- The bundle is non-empty, contains a script element, and references the
  charting library (Plotly) so it can't silently drift to a different lib.
- The bundle has a root container element.
- The handler returns the same bytes as the file on disk (no surprise
  transformation at registration time).
- Bundle weight stays under the 100KB warning threshold (the plan's
  Gotcha G3 — heavy bundles hurt latency over the MCP transport).
