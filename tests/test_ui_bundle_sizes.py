"""Bundle-size budget for ``ui://`` resources (v2.0 Phase 6b).

The MCP Apps spec ships each bundle as a single ``resources/read`` payload
back to the host. Heavy bundles slow every tool call that binds to them
(host has to fetch them on first render), and a runaway bundle can blow
through transport buffers on stdio. We enforce a budget in CI so a future
agent that decides to inline Plotly or Cesium gets caught immediately.

Two thresholds (matched to the v2.0 plan §6b):

- ``WARN_BYTES`` (100 KB): emits a pytest warning. The bundle is still
  shipping; the test does not fail. Triggers a Codex/Copilot review nudge.
- ``ERROR_BYTES`` (1 MB): hard fail. No ``ui://`` bundle should approach
  this; if it does, we want CI to stop the PR.

Current baseline (May 2026): largest bundle is ``app_vulnerability_v1.html``
at ~33 KB — every bundle has a comfortable 3× margin to the warn line and
a 30× margin to the error line.
