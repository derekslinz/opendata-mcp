# meta-data-mcp

> A single MCP server that transparently routes user requests to 66 open-data sources.

`meta-data-mcp` is one MCP server — not many. Under the hood it bundles 66 *plugins*, each wrapping a different open-data API. The plugins are an implementation detail; from your LLM's perspective there is one server, one set of tools, and one place to ask "where can I find data about X?"

You install one server. You get all the data, discoverable through built-in routing tools.

## Why "meta"?

Finding open data isn't the hard part — there's an absurd amount of it available. The hard part is finding the right dataset *when you need it*. `meta-data-mcp` makes that automatic:

- The LLM calls `opendata-find-providers` ("FX rates", "court rulings", "earthquakes near Lisbon") and the server routes the query against an internal registry of every bundled plugin.
- The LLM then calls the matching tool directly. No setup step in between, no separate servers, no per-provider install rituals.

This project was forked from [opendata-mcp](https://github.com/OpenDataMCP/OpenDataMCP) and reshaped around the single-server idea once the catalogue passed a few dozen plugins.

## Installation

You'll need `uv` (a Python package manager).

```bash
# macOS — install uv via Homebrew so MCP clients can find it
brew install uv

# Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then register the server with every MCP client installed on your machine:

```bash
uv run meta-data-mcp setup
```

The command auto-detects which MCP clients you have installed and adds **one** `meta-data-mcp` entry under `mcpServers` in each. Supported clients:

| Client | Config file |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) / `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows) |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| LM Studio | `~/.cache/lm-studio/mcp.json` |

Each existing config is backed up to `<file>.bak` before writing. Restart the affected client(s) and you'll see one new server with discovery tools + every plugin's tools available under it.

Inspect what's detected / configured on your machine:

```bash
uv run meta-data-mcp clients
```

Target a single client (or write to every supported client regardless of detection):

```bash
uv run meta-data-mcp setup --client claude-code
uv run meta-data-mcp setup --client all
```

If you want to see the JSON snippet without touching any config file (e.g. to paste into a client we don't support yet):

```bash
uv run meta-data-mcp setup --print-json
```

When `META_DATA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, `--print-json` also surfaces the SSE-client snippet (with the real token) to stderr so you can wire a remote client.

### Hosting `meta-data-mcp` as a remote SSE server

For deploying behind your own domain with bearer-token authentication, see [`docs/hosting.md`](docs/hosting.md). It covers `systemd`, Caddy/nginx TLS termination, token rotation, and the threat model.

## CLI

There is one server, so the CLI takes no "provider" argument. Every command operates on the one `meta-data-mcp` server.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `uv run meta-data-mcp run` | Run the server (default SSE; pass `--transport stdio` for Claude Desktop). |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp setup` | Register the server in Claude Desktop's config. |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp remove` | Unregister the server from Claude Desktop. |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp cleanup` | Detect and remove legacy multi-server entries (`--apply` to commit). |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp inspect` | Launch [mcp-inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) against the server. |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp list` | Informational: list the internal plugins bundled in this server. |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp info` | Informational: show server overview. Pass `--plugin <name>` for plugin-level details. |
| `uv run meta-data-mcp version` | Print the package version. |

The `list` command exists for transparency about what's bundled — **plugins are not separately installable, runnable, or addressable**. They are loaded automatically when the server starts.


## Server tools (what the LLM calls)

Once `meta-data-mcp` is running, the LLM has access to two layers of tools — and you don't need to mention either to the user:

1. **Meta tools** — the eight server-level tools below. They make routing transparent: the LLM uses them to find (or create) the right plugin without you telling it which tool to call.
2. **Plugin tools** — ~330 tools coming from the 66 bundled plugins. They are merged into the same namespace at startup. The LLM picks one after consulting the meta tools.

### Meta tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `opendata-find-providers` | Free-text search over the plugin registry. Returns ranked matches. When nothing matches the response carries a `no_match: true` flag and a `next_step` hint pointing at `opendata-draft-spec` + `opendata-create-plugin`. |
| `opendata-explain-choice` | Show the scoring breakdown for a search (useful for debugging routing decisions). |
| `opendata-list-domains` | Enumerate the controlled domain vocabulary (`health`, `legal`, `finance`, `earth-science`, …). |
| `opendata-list-regions` | Enumerate the controlled region vocabulary (`us`, `eu`, `uk`, `global`, …). |
| `opendata-describe-provider` | Full metadata for one plugin by id — title, description, domains, regions, keywords, homepage, required env vars. |
| `opendata-list-providers` | Paginated dump of the whole registry. |
| `opendata-draft-spec` | **Build a validated plugin YAML spec from structured inputs.** Takes id, base_url, tool definitions (name, endpoint, params), and registry metadata. Validates id/tool-name casing, path-placeholder/param consistency, and parameter types, then emits a YAML string ready to feed into `opendata-create-plugin`. Use this so the LLM never has to hand-author YAML. |
| `opendata-create-plugin` | **Autonomously create a new plugin.** Takes a YAML spec (typically produced by `opendata-draft-spec`), runs the generator, imports the new module, registers it in the live registry, and hot-loads its tools onto the running server. Use this when `opendata-find-providers` returns no match. |

### The autonomous discovery flow

The reason this server is called "meta" is that it routes data requests on the user's behalf — including by *creating* the route when one doesn't exist yet. The full flow:

1. **User asks for data**, e.g. "show me the most recent published CVEs."
2. **LLM calls `opendata-find-providers`** with the query (`cve`, `vulnerability`, …).
3. **If the registry has a match**: the LLM picks the matching plugin's tool and answers — done.
4. **If the registry has no match**: the response includes `no_match: true` and a `next_step` field that explains the autonomous creation path. The LLM:
   1. Tells the user it's about to add coverage for this data source.
   2. Web-searches for an open API that exposes the requested data (e.g. the NVD or CIRCL CVE API).
   3. Calls `opendata-draft-spec` with the API's id, base URL, and structured tool definitions. The server validates the inputs (id casing, path-placeholder consistency, parameter types) and returns a YAML string.
   4. Passes that YAML to `opendata-create-plugin`. The server materializes the plugin module + tests, imports the module, registers a `ProviderEntry` in the in-memory dynamic registry, and merges the new tools into the running server's tool list.
   5. Calls the newly-available tool to answer the user's original question.
5. **User gets their answer** — and the plugin remains available for the rest of the session.

The materialized plugin lives on disk (`meta_data_mcp/providers/{id}.py` + `tests/providers/test_{id}.py`); contributors can clean it up, add it to `meta_data_mcp/registry.py` as a static entry, and open a PR so it becomes part of every shipped install.

### Plugin tools

Every bundled plugin contributes its own tools under the one server. Their names are unique kebab-case identifiers, often using a provider-specific prefix (e.g. `usgs-eq-feed-significant-week`, `frankfurter-latest`, `wikipedia-fetch-summary`). The LLM discovers them through `opendata-find-providers` and `opendata-describe-provider`; you don't need to memorize them.

## Optional environment variables

A few bundled plugins accept optional API keys for higher rate limits. Set these in your shell or in the Claude Desktop server config's `env` block:

| Variable | Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` | `us_courtlistener` | Anonymous access works at low volumes |
| `OPENDATA_MCP_CONTACT` | all | Your email, used in User-Agent for polite-pool APIs (Crossref, OpenAlex, OSM, SEC EDGAR). Defaults to `opendata-mcp@example.org`. |

## Transports

`run` defaults to **SSE** (HTTP, port 8000) so you can connect from the MCP Inspector or remote clients. For Claude Desktop (which the `setup` command targets), the spawned process uses **stdio**:

```bash
uv run meta-data-mcp run                                  # SSE on 127.0.0.1:8000
uv run meta-data-mcp run --transport stdio                # stdio
uv run meta-data-mcp run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001       # SSE bound to all interfaces
```


## Roadmap

- **v1.2 — Hierarchical discovery:** `opendata-list-subcategories` and `opendata-browse-providers` tools so users can browse domain → subcategory → provider when they don't know what they need.
- **v1.3 — Agent-driven generation:** Hook the routing engine's no-match path into an agent that finds an open API, generates a provider module, and registers it automatically — closing coverage gaps without user intervention.
- Public hosted deployment with SSE so non-Claude clients can use the server remotely.
- Multi-language SDK clients for the discovery tools so non-MCP integrations get the same routing benefits.


## Credits

- Originally conceived by [grll](https://github.com/grll) as `opendata-mcp`.
- Forked and reshaped around the single-server "meta-mcp" model.
- Built on [Anthropic's open-source MCP spec](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/).
