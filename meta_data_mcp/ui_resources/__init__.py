"""MCP Apps shape primitives and apps (v2.0 Phases 2 & 3).

Two flavors of UI resource live here:

- ``ui://meta-data-mcp/shape/<name>/<version>`` — *primitives*: passive
  renderers for the three canonical payload contracts (timeseries,
  geofeatures, records). Phase 2.

- ``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/<name>/<version>`` — *apps*: interactive
  panels that issue outbound ``tool_call`` messages back to the host.
  Phase 3 shipped ``discovery``; Phase 5 adds ``vulnerability`` /
  ``museum`` / ``molecular`` / ``news-tone`` / ``network-topology``
  and will add ``entity-graph`` / ``trade-flows`` / etc. as follow-ups.

The two public entry points are :func:`register_shapes` and
:func:`register_apps`, called once from the discovery provider during
server boot. Each registers its resources against the server's shared
``RESOURCES`` / ``RESOURCES_HANDLERS`` collections.

# Canonical catalog of every ui:// resource this package ships. Surfaced as
# a flat mapping so callers that need to introspect the full set (tests,
# bundle-budget checks, future tooling like an MCP-Apps lint pass) don't
# have to re-walk every submodule. Architecture review §M1 (v2.1 hygiene
# pass).
#
# Keys are stable identifiers — "<class>/<name>/<version>" — chosen to
# match the dict keys returned by ``register_shapes`` and ``register_apps``
# so the three surfaces stay aligned. Adding a new shape or app means
# adding to BOTH this mapping AND the corresponding register_* function.
# tests/test_ui_resources_catalog.py pins the alignment so a half-wired
# addition fails CI.
