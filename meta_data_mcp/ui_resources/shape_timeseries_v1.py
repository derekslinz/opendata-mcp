"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/shape/timeseries/v1`` — line-chart shape primitive.

The bundle (``shape_timeseries_v1.html``) renders payloads of the form::

    {
      "points":      [{"date": ..., "value": <number>, "series"?: ...}, ...],
      "axes":        {"x": "<label>", "y": "<label>"},
      "annotations": [{"date": ..., "label": ..., "value"?: <number>}, ...]
    }

It's CDN-loaded Plotly + ~16KB of self-contained HTML/JS. The CDN origin
(``cdn.plot.ly``) is documented in the bundle so Phase 4 provider adopters
can wire it into each tool's ``_meta.ui.csp`` correctly.

See ``Plans/linear-swimming-pond.md`` §2a for the coverage matrix.
