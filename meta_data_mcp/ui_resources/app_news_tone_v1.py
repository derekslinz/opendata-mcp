"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/news-tone/v1`` — Phase 5 news-tone app.

Surfaces the GDELT 2.0 DOC API event-stream as one panel. GDELT is the
only upstream — every other Phase 5 app multiplexes across providers, but
GDELT's tone+country+timestamp tuple is rich enough on its own to drive a
timeline + tone overlay + country chord without help.

Tools wrapped:

- ``gdelt-article-search`` — ArtList mode, returns per-article
  ``url`` / ``title`` / ``seendate`` / ``sourcecountry`` / ``tone``. The
  events feed and the country-chord co-occurrence both fall out of this
  one response.
- ``gdelt-volume-timeline`` — TimelineTone mode, returns the daily
  average tone series that overlays on top of the per-article lollipops.

The chord is derived in-bundle: each calendar day's distinct source
countries form an undirected co-occurrence edge, weighted by number of
shared days. That avoids requiring a per-country fan-out call.

postMessage protocol matches the Phase 3 discovery app — see that module
for the full envelope description. Visualisations are inline SVG (no
chart library, no CDN) so the bundle stays dependency-free.

See ``Plans/linear-swimming-pond.md`` §5 — the planned "Timeline + tone
overlay + country chord" deliverable lives here.
