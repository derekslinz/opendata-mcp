"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/discovery/v1`` — Phase 3 discovery app.

Wraps the five discovery meta tools plus ``opendata-health-snapshot`` into
one panel: faceted filter (domain × region × text), ranked provider list
with score breakdown + health badge, click-to-activate, bottom active-
provider tray.

Unlike the ``ui://shape/*`` primitives this is a first-class *app*, not a
passive renderer: it issues outbound ``tool_call`` messages to the host so
filter changes and activations execute live. The host→app envelope mirrors
the shape primitives (``{type: "tool_result" | "render", payload}``).

The bundle is dependency-free vanilla JS — the discovery panel is text +
buttons, no chart libraries needed. That keeps this PR's wire surface
small enough to validate the MCP Apps pipeline end-to-end before Phase 5
spends weeks on the custom-shape apps.

See ``Plans/linear-swimming-pond.md`` §3.
