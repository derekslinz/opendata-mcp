"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/museum/v1`` — Phase 5 museum app.

Wraps the Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access tools into one
image-driven panel:

- **``met-search``** (``global_met_museum``) — free-text search that
  returns a list of ``objectIDs`` matching a query plus optional
  faceted filters (department, medium, geography, date range).
- **``met-get-object``** (``global_met_museum``) — full single-object
  metadata: title, artist, date, medium, primary image URL, plus the
  provenance / culture / dimensions / repository text the Met
  publishes alongside each Open-Access record.

The panel renders the returned objects as a lazy-loaded CSS-grid of
thumbnails; clicking a tile opens a detail panel with the full
provenance and a link back to metmuseum.org. The Met Open Access
program publishes every public-domain image under Creative Commons
Zero, which makes a "browse the Met" surface the natural Phase 5
image-driven app.

postMessage protocol inherits the Phase 3 ``tool_call`` envelope —
see ``app_discovery_v1`` for the full description. ``met-search``
returns just object IDs (no embedded image/title metadata), so the
bundle's recommended host wiring is to hydrate each ID with a
follow-up ``met-get-object`` call before pushing the envelope to the
app. The bundle accepts either shape: a pre-hydrated
``{objects: [{id, title, image_url, ...}, ...]}`` payload (the
documented contract) **or** a raw ``{objectIDs: [...]}`` payload —
the host integrator's choice.

Visualisations are pure CSS grid + ``<img loading="lazy">`` — no
chart library, no canvas, no CDN. The bundle stays dependency-free
like the records primitive.
