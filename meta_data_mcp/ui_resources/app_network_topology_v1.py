"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/network-topology/v1`` — Phase 5 ASN graph app.

Force-directed visualisation of BGP/ASN-level network topology.
Synthesises data from two providers:

- **RIPE NCC RIPEstat** (``global_ripe_stat``) — authoritative source
  of BGP neighbour relationships. ``ripestat-asn-neighbours`` returns
  the current peer/upstream/downstream ASNs for any focus ASN;
  ``ripestat-asn-neighbours-history`` returns the same data over a
  time window. The unrelated ``ripestat-geoloc`` tool is bound to the
  Phase 4 geofeatures shape primitive and is NOT touched by this app.
- **BGPView.io** (``global_bgpview``) — historically a complementary
  source for peers/upstreams/downstreams. The upstream API is offline,
  but the binding remains for protocol completeness so a future
  drop-in replacement provider lights up the same panel automatically.

Payload contract — host pushes a JSON object of this shape into the
panel via the standard MCP Apps postMessage envelope::

    {
      "asns":  [{"asn": <int>, "name": "...", "country": "...",
                 "rank": <number>?}],
      "edges": [{"source_asn": <int>, "target_asn": <int>,
                 "relationship": "peer"|"upstream"|"downstream",
                 "weight": <number>?}],
      "focus_asn": <int>?
    }

``focus_asn`` (when present) is rendered with a thicker stroke + larger
radius and is pinned at the centre of the viewport so the layout stays
stable across click-to-expand merges. Edges fall back to ``peer`` if
their declared ``relationship`` isn't one of the three canonical values.

Interactions:

- Click an ASN node → fires an ``app→host`` ``tool_call`` for
  ``ripestat-asn-neighbours`` with that ASN; new nodes/edges merge into
  the existing graph (no full re-render of unaffected layout).
- Hover an ASN node → tooltip with AS number, holder, country, rank,
  and current degree (number of incident edges).
- ``Load`` button → typed ASN focus reset + initial neighbour fetch.
- ``Reset`` button → clears the graph back to idle.

D3.js v7 (loaded via jsdelivr CDN) is the only dependency: the force
simulation, drag, and zoom primitives are not worth reimplementing
in-bundle for this app. The rest of the apps in this repo are
dependency-free; D3 is justified here because rolling our own physics
sim would inflate the bundle far past the 100KB Phase 6b budget for no
UX gain.

postMessage protocol matches the Phase 3 discovery app envelope — see
``app_discovery_v1.py`` for the full description.
