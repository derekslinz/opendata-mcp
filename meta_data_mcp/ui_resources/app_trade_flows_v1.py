"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/trade-flows/v1`` — Phase 5 trade-flows app.

Renders bilateral merchandise + services trade reported to the UN by
200+ national statistical authorities as a coordinated Sankey + treemap
pair:

- **UN Comtrade** (``global_un_comtrade``) — annual / monthly trade
  rows keyed by reporter, partner, commodity (HS/SITC/BEC/EBOPS),
  flow, and value. Sankey lays the rows out as a 3-layer flow
  reporter → commodity → partner; the treemap aggregates the same
  rows by commodity total so dominant categories surface at a glance.

UN Comtrade is the only upstream — the panel exists to make a single
provider's reporter↔partner↔commodity↔value tuples legible at a
glance. Multi-provider variants (e.g. cross-validating tariff lines
against another customs authority) can land later without changing
the bundle, since the wrapped payload contract is provider-agnostic.

The bundle accepts either the wrapped ``{flows: [...]}`` form or a
raw UN Comtrade ``{data: [...]}`` envelope; the normaliser tolerates
both ``camelCase`` (raw API) and ``snake_case`` (wrapped) keys so a
host integrator doesn't have to reshape responses before forwarding
them. See the inline payload contract in the HTML bundle for the
full key list.

postMessage protocol matches the Phase 3 discovery + Phase 5
vulnerability apps — see those modules for the full envelope
description.

Dependencies: D3.js + d3-sankey are pulled from jsDelivr at runtime;
they're heavy enough that inlining the Sankey + treemap arithmetic by
hand would dwarf the bundle. The other Phase 5 apps stay
dependency-free where they can; this one trades two CDN scripts for
a polished layout under 100KB.
