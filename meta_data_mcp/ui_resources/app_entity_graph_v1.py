"""``ui://meta-data-mcp/app/entity-graph/v1`` — Phase 5 entity-graph app.

Renders a force-directed graph of entities and their relationships
from four independent providers:

- **OpenAlex** (``global_openalex``) — work↔author↔concept edges for
  scholarly research; doubles as the co-author overlay surface called
  out in ``Plans/linear-swimming-pond.md`` §5.
- **Wikidata** (``global_wikidata``) — item entities returned from a
  free-text search; each result is a labelled node hanging off a
  central "anchor" node that represents the query itself.
- **OpenSanctions** (``global_opensanctions``) — persons / companies /
  vessels and their related-entity cross-references.
- **Crossref** (``global_crossref``) — co-author overlay rooted at the
  named author (work↔author edges). ``crossref-works-search`` is
  intentionally NOT rebound here — it remains on the records primitive
  per Phase 4; ``crossref-works-by-author`` is the entity-graph hook.

Payload contract (provider → app via the host's ``tool_result``):

    {
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "...", "label": "...", "type": "author|work|entity|...",
         "attrs": {...optional metadata...}}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"source": "<node-id>", "target": "<node-id>",
         "label": "...", "weight": <optional number>}
      ],
      "facets": [...]   // optional, currently unused
    }

Each provider ships a small ``_to_entity_graph_payload(...)`` adapter
that flattens its native response into ``nodes`` + ``edges``. The
bundle never sees raw upstream JSON — it sees a uniform shape
regardless of which provider populated it.

Bundle stack: D3.js v7 force-directed graph, loaded from
``cdn.jsdelivr.net`` (the canonical D3 CDN). The bundle degrades to a
flat node list if the CDN is unreachable so a CSP block or offline
environment never produces a blank screen.

postMessage envelope is inherited from the Phase 3 discovery app and
the Phase 5 vulnerability app — see those modules for the bidirectional
description.
