"""Mutable activation state for the meta server.

The meta server in :mod:`meta_data_mcp.providers.meta_data_mcp` owns
five pieces of state that change as plugins activate and deactivate at
runtime: the advertised tool list, the tool-name → handler map, the
set of activated provider ids, the tool-name → owning-provider map,
and an optional reference to the running ``Server`` instance (used to
fire ``tools/list_changed`` notifications when activation mutates the
catalog).

Pre-v2.1 these were five module-level globals. Bundling them into one
:class:`ActivationState` dataclass shrinks the test surface (snapshot /
restore is one call, not five), keeps the "what's mutable about the
discovery surface" question answerable in one file, and stops new
mutable state from being silently added without touching every test
fixture.

The module-level ``_state`` singleton plus the back-compat alias names
(``TOOLS``, ``TOOLS_HANDLERS``, ``RESOURCES``, ``RESOURCES_HANDLERS``,
``_active_providers``, ``_owner_by_tool``) live here too — the meta
server module re-exports them so existing call sites
(``from meta_data_mcp.providers.meta_data_mcp import TOOLS``) keep
working unchanged.

**Critical invariant.** ``TOOLS`` and ``TOOLS_HANDLERS`` are the *same*
list and dict objects passed into ``create_mcp_server``. Mutating them
in place (``TOOLS.append(...)``, ``TOOLS_HANDLERS[name] = handler``,
``TOOLS[:] = [...]``) is the mechanism by which the running server's
advertised catalog stays in sync with activation. Do not reassign
either name.
