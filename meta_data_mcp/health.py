"""
In-memory provider health registry.

Tracks per-provider failure / success events and exposes a health score in
``[0.0, 1.0]`` for use by routing scorers. Recent failures lower the score;
the score decays back toward 1.0 over time (exponential decay with a ~5 minute
characteristic) so transient outages don't permanently penalize a provider.

This module is intentionally process-local and thread-safe. There is no
persistence across restarts — see the related plan for follow-up work.

The monotonic clock is read via ``_clock`` so tests can inject a fake clock to
drive decay deterministically.
